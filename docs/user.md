# langModels

A series of language models that students can run for inference to explore their performance.

Created from scratch with just a neural network for modeling data from a sine wave. This is to ensure the software all works in integration tests. Following that, more models will be added (Shannon ngrams (letters); Shannon ngrams (words); Bengio neural network model of language with a small context window; basic transformer models; larger transformer models; external LLMs).
